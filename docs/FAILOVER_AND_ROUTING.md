# Multi-Cloud Failover & Routing Guide

This guide explains how to achieve high availability and resilience for your Student PM API by deploying to multiple cloud vendors and setting up failover/routing.

---

## 1. Why Multi-Cloud & Failover?
- **Avoid downtime** if one vendor has an outage or you hit a free tier quota.
- **Seamless upgrades** and blue/green deployments.
- **Global performance** by routing users to the nearest/fastest region.

---

## 2. Deploy to Multiple Vendors
- Use the same Docker image and environment variable setup for all vendors (Railway, Render, Fly.io, etc.).
- Each deployment gets its own public URL (e.g., `https://api-railway.example.com`, `https://api-render.example.com`).
- Use different databases or DB files for each environment, or a shared external DB if needed.

---

## 3. Routing & Failover Options

### A. DNS-Based Failover
- Use a managed DNS provider (e.g., Cloudflare, AWS Route53, Google Domains).
- Set up multiple A/AAAA/CNAME records for your API domain, each pointing to a different vendor’s URL/IP.
- Use DNS health checks to automatically switch traffic if one endpoint is down.
- **Example:**
  - `api.example.com` → primary: Railway, secondary: Render

### B. API Gateway or Load Balancer
- Use a cloud API gateway (e.g., AWS API Gateway, Kong, NGINX, Traefik) to route traffic to healthy backends.
- Can do advanced routing (geo, weighted, canary, etc.).
- Can run your own gateway on a VM or as a managed service.

### C. Client-Side Fallback (Simple)
- In your frontend/mobile app, try the primary API endpoint first.
- If it fails, automatically retry with the secondary endpoint.
- Good for simple apps or when DNS/gateway is not available.

---

## 4. Health Checks & Monitoring
- Set up health checks (HTTP GET `/api/health` or `/api/users/me` with a test token) on each deployment.
- Use your DNS provider or monitoring service to check health and switch traffic if needed.
- Set up alerts for downtime or errors.

---

## 5. Best Practices
- **Keep environment variables and secrets in sync** across all vendors.
- **Document which vendor is primary/secondary** for each environment.
- **Test failover regularly** to ensure it works as expected.
- **Monitor usage and quotas** on all vendors.
- **Use HTTPS and custom domains** for all endpoints.

---

## 6. Example Workflow
1. Deploy to Railway and Render with the same Docker image and env vars.
2. Set up `api.example.com` in Cloudflare with primary to Railway, secondary to Render.
3. Configure health checks to monitor both endpoints.
4. If Railway is down, Cloudflare automatically routes to Render.
5. Your frontend/mobile app always uses `api.example.com`.
